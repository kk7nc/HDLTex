Installation
------------

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: bash
    
    pip install HDLTex
    
Using git
~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kk7nc/HDLTex.git


The primary requirements for this package are Python 3 with Tensorflow.
The requirements.txt file contains a listing of the required Python
packages; to install all requirements, run the following:

.. code:: bash

    pip -r install requirements.txt

Or

.. code:: bash

    pip3  install -r requirements.txt

Or:

.. code:: bash

    conda install --file requirements.txt
        

If the above command does not work, use the following:

.. code:: bash

    sudo -H pip  install -r requirements.txt

**Documentation:**


Increasingly large document collections require improved information processing methods for searching, retrieving, and organizing  text. Central to these information processing methods is document classification, which has become an important application for supervised learning. Recently the performance of traditional supervised classifiers has degraded as the number of documents has increased. This is because along with growth in the number of documents has come an increase in the number of categories. This paper approaches this problem differently from current document classification methods that view the problem as multi-class classification. Instead we perform hierarchical classification using an approach we call Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text classification (HDLTex). HDLTex employs stacks of deep learning architectures to provide specialized understanding at each level of the document hierarchy.
